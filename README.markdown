# acme-omitted: purely functional omitted content for Haskell

Haskell has long lacked the ability to express the notion of "omitted content",
making it impossible to differentiate between the truly "undefined" and
the merely "omitted".

acme-omitted introduces the universal omitted content operator, bringing sanity
and order back into the world of Haskell. It is standards-compliant,
backwards-compatible, type-safe, and user-friendly.
